    <h1>Darby's Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Here you will find links to three projects 
            I created for a class assignment. I had never coded 
            before, so I learned quite a bit about how to create 
            what could be a website. What I found most appealing 
            to me is learning how to include images, so now if I 
            ever were try and make my own digital portfolio from 
            scratch, I'd have some idea of what I was doing. Theme-wise, 
            I mostly discussed memory and how that makes us who we 
            are, ranting about how much of what we remember is emotion,
            it's accuracy, and importance. Visually, I wanted the webpages 
            to each have a monochromatic color scheme, being light green, 
            red, and blue. </p>
        <p>Here's the links to those projects:</p>
