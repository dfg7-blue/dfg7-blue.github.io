<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Project Notes</h2>
      <p>This project was about created an animated GIF by using the Video Timeline 
        tool in Adobe Photoshop. We had done a previous assignment following a tutorial to 
        create a frame animated GIF as well.The size of the final product is 500x500 
        pixels, and the animation between 2 and 5 seconds long that loops to create a seemless 
        loop animation. The subject matter and the direction of the animation was left 
        up to us, and we had the option to create a second one. </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Process Documentation</h3>
      <img src="images/162045.png" alt="cartoon rain drops" 
           style="width:500px;"> 
      <p>This is the image I selected for my animation, since I liked the flat 
        colors and the idea of making it look as though it was raining. Another reason for this image choise
        was the staggered pattern, which made it easy to stack the image. So, I opened 
        the image into Photoshop, resized the image, and then used the Selection tool 
        to remove the white background. <br> To create the seemless loop for the animation, 
        I then copied the image, and dragged it below the first image so the amount 
        of rain drops were doubled. Then, I opened the Video Timeline tool, and set the start 
        and the end of the animation by dragging the two layers to the very bottom, then the 
        very top, making sure the ends matched up with each other. I set those as the keyframes, 
        and set the animation for about two seconds. The only trouble I had was making the 
        loop completely smooth, and it took some tweaking to get it just right so there wasn't 
        an odd skip in the animation when the loop resets. </p>
    
      <p></p>
 <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Reflection</h4>  
      <p>I was very excited for this project, since I've been wanting to learn 
        animation for a while now, and I wasn't dissapointed with the results 
        of the project. I was able to make the loop smooth, and created the desired 
        effect of making a raining GIF. Now, while I found the Timeline Animation easier 
        than the Frame Animation method, I'll most likely end up using the more 
        traditional method of frame-animated, and maybe use the Timeline method for 
        tweening animatics in the future. The final product is a bit of a darker blue, 
        since I wanted a more 'blue' rain that contrasts a bit better against whatever 
        background it's on. </p>
