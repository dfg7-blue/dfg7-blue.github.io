        <h1 style="color: darkblue;">Distortion</h1>
        <p style="color: darkblue;">There's always going to be distortion in our lives. 
        People like to refer to that as 'perspective', and that's a 
        nice way to think about it, but really our brain processes 
        fact and distorts it to fit our own narrative. It's takes 
            training yourself to be objective and practical, to 
            prevent a distortion on information. Now, it's not always 
            bad, since bringing a new perspective to a topic can shake
            things up, but when discussing statistics, graphs, and data 
            there's very little room allowed for personal interpretations. 
            Can this thought process be considered 'cold?' <b>Yes.</b></p>

        <h2 style="color: darkblue;">Memory</h2>
        <p style="color: darkblue;"> With the distortion comes our memory. Our memory is a great 
            contributor to the distortion of information. After a certain 
            number of years, our memory can only recall about almost <i>half</i> 
            of the information from a memory correctly. But most of the 
            time it's not about accuracy. Most of the time, if the memory 
            is good, our brain will expell the nonsense information to retain 
            the good information, and then in other, more extreme cases our 
            brains will rewrite themselves to protect us from traumatic memories 
            to ensure our emotional survival.</p>
