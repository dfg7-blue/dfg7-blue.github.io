<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Project Notes</h2>
      <p>This project was when we were introduced to .html coding, and was tasked with 
        coding three different pages on Pheonix Code, all linked to each other for easy navigation, 
        showcasing the range of coding we could do. Be it, font size, text color, and 
        image inclusions. On each page we were to discuss certain topics breifly, like 
        memory, creativity, distortion, and the like. To go along with this project, we were
        asked to create an animated GIF for one of the pages. Afterwards, these were to be all 
        gathered on an Index page, like a homepage, to allow the contents to be easily 
        accessable. After all the pages were coded and complete, they were to be published
        on github pages. </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Process Documentation</h3>
      <img src=tree_glitch.jpg alt="black and white tree" 
           style="width:550;height:500px;"> 
    <img src=glitch_grit.gif alt="downwards moving red arrow" 
           style="width:500px;height:500px;"> 
      <p>These were the two artifacts that I included into my project, creating the arrows following the 
    Timeline Animation method, and finding the still image of the tree to recolor as black-and-white. 
        After that, I created a base format for my first page, titled Intro. It was simple, and 
        I decided to make the background and the text colored blue, and copied and pasted the coding for 
        the next two pages, changing the colors two red for Texture, and yellow for Echo. I 
        included the image of the tree in all three, and added the red arrow GIF to the Texture page 
        for some variety. For the text, I mostly rambled about whatever came to mind when pondering more 
        philosophical topics. The final step of creating the Index page was easy, although github did give 
        me some trouble.</p>
 <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Reflection</h4>  
      <p>Overall, while I kept my project simple, I'm happy with the results. Learning how to 
        code is a good skill to have, in any type of environment, and I'm happy to have some knowledge and skills, 
    no matter how limited they are at the moment. Although only a small part of the entire project, I'm quite happy
    with the red arrow, finding some amusement watching it scrolling downwards over and over again. If I were to change 
    anything, I would have had a different image for each page instead of using the tree for all three of them, 
    but linking an edited image it quite easy, so I don't think it took away from the projects difficulty. </p>
