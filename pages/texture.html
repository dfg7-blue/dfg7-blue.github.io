        <h1 style="color: darkred;">The Failure of AI Art</h1>
        <p style="color: darkred;">Although I had to research what the term 
            'aesthetic failure' actually meant, I find it fits the climate 
            of AI generated art. In what can be used in wonderful ways outside of art,
            has been corrupted by those unable to put in the effort to actually 
            learn a skill. It is not art. It is a series of code that generates 
            pixles based off of a word prompt. It is soulless, and is the very epitome
            of a true artists worst nightmare, it is <b>vile</b>. If I were to ask what 
            composition they used, what medium, what drawing program, what type of brush, 
        what color pallete and why, what element of art did they focus on--they 
            have nothing to say. Art isn't meant to be acessable. It isn't a telephone 
            you can use for a quarter. It is a skill that is developed, earned. Not stolen 
            and distorted through the use of a coded computer intelligence program.</p>

        <h2 style="color: darkred;">Distortion</h2>
        <p style="color: darkred;"> This distortion placed upon the use of AI generated
            art, photos and videos is disgusting. It is viewed by a section of the masses
        as a 'short-cut' into art, while companies view it as a way to save money and generate 
            posters and even entire ads with AI. Both of these aren't true. The job crises is 
            only going to get worse the further this distortion goes, for all jobs, really. Actors 
            won't be hired for ads anymore, marketers won't be hired for logo designs and marketing 
            strategies, and job recruiters are already being affected with the rise of AI generated 
            job interviews. Creatively, companies won't hire artists to design illustrations, coloring books, 
        animate series, and <i>much more.</i> </p>
