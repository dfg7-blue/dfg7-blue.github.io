      <p> This project required pulling images from 
      the internet and resizing the image to a specified 
          limited pixel amount. Each pixel amount--16px, 32px, 64px, and 
          128px--was
          to have two images each, making a total of eight pixelated images.
          The resulting images 
          was to resemble, or at least capture the original image
      in it's essense or content in a reduced state of image quality.</p>
      
<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Project Notes</h2>
      <p>For this project, I had not yet received my 
        temporary student Photoshop liscence, so I 
        created this project in Clip Studio. 
        Although I did complete the project on time and to satisfaction, 
        the process was a bit...janky. Clip Studio is not meant to be used 
        in such a way, so it was a bit of a back and forth the whole way through.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Process Documentation</h3>
      <img src=original%20bird.jpg alt="Two green birds standing on flowers" 
           style="width:500px;height:320px;"> 
      <p>This is the original that I extraced my choice image from for one of the 
          the 32 pixel images. I was drawn to the bright, crips colors of the yellow flower and green bird, 
      thinking that they would communicate well at the reduced pixel amount. Looking at the surrounding
      details, I can see that this photo has either been heavily edited already, or been processed by 
      AI. Seems fitting that it would go through another round of transformation by my hands.</p>
      <img src="174902.png"
           alt="first pixelated image of one of the green birds" 
           style="width:500px;height:500px">
      <p>This was one of the first images I made during the project, and since I was still 
      trying to work out the correct formating of the pixelated images, I ended up
      with this hot mess. I was going back and forth between pixel amount and image size, since 
      they were two different things that couldn't be the same in Clip Studio. So, what I ended up doing
      was created the desired pixelated image, take a screen shot with my canvas zoomed in to the max, 
      and then created a new dcument to then size the image without messing with the desired pixel effect.
      Very backwards and not at all what our process was supposed to be, but that is what I had to do at the time.
      If there's a will there's a way. </p>
 <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Reflection</h4>  
      <p>I will say, I learned quite a bit about the history of the pixel. I didn't learn much else, 
      outside of the fact that Clip Studio is not meant for this type of work process in anyway shape or form. 
      Which is fine, seeing as it's a program meant for comic illustration and digital art. Outside of the actual 
      project topic, I learned quite a bit about how far I'm willing to go to make something work, 
      to the point where all I have left is a saved file of a resized screenshot of a tiny pixelated image.
      </p>
