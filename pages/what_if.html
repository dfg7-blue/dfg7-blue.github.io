<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Project Notes</h2>
      <p>This project called for creating a token that had a specific theme, including text, 
    icons, symbols, and images. This was to resemble the several collectable coin token designs
        for several different topics, like historic figures, events, or loations. 
        To design the token, we were to use Adobe Illustrator, and all the 
    different tools included to design a couple itterations of our token. </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Process Documentation</h3>
      <p>I wanted to do a cryptid's theme, so I pulled several images of crypids around the United States of 
    America, and thought of an idea that revolved around earning a token coin at each cryptid location, 
    that is--if you weren't killed by them in the process. I settled on the Mothman, liking him the best out of 
    all the cryptids found in the USA. So, I wanted to have the Mothman as the center piece of the token, surrounded
        by the symbols of Point Pleasant, the town in West Virginia where the stories of Mothman originate. The 
        first has the stars of the cites flag surrounding Mothman. I wanted to keep the color pallete simple, 
        sticking to just red and black. I then wrapped the text within the token, including his name and his place of 
        origin. I kept the text and image of Mothman the same for the second token design, but instead included 
        an image of the Silver Bridge, the bridge seen in many of the cities promotional images. </p>
 <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Reflection</h4>  
      <p>Between these two, I prefer the second design. The stars leave too much space in the design, 
    and are not spaced correctly to perfectly center Mothman. I had a tough time wrapping the text and making sure to 
    size it correctly, as well as finding the tool to erase the background of the images I included, having to retreat to 
    Photoshop to do that, then upload the results to Illustrator. The final product may be a little messy in areas, 
    but I'm quite proud of my designs. I like how blocky and geometrical it looks, which is suprising for me, since
    I tend to favor more sleek work. Overall, I learned quite a bit, not only about Adobe Illustrator, but also about my 
    topic of choice. </p>
