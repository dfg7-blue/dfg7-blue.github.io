<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Project Notes</h2>
      <p>This project takes us to p5.js, a coding website that specializes in images, 
        both interactive and still. It's a very flexible way of coding, and with that in mind 
        the project asked for a landscape, and a self portrait to be made in p5.js using shapes 
        and colors. For the landscape, it required at least twelve different shapes, while the self portrait
    didn't have a minimum. These projects are called 'sketches', and despite the limiting detail were to 
        represent the subject requested.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Process Documentation</h3>
      <p>The first one I worked on was the landscape, thinking it was going to be the more 
    difficult one with the minimum shape requirement. I started with the trees, creating them
    at different sizes to create the illusion of depth, and included grass, a mountain in the back so 
    the sky wasn't so empty, and a sliver of a river. I ended up using exactly twelve shapes for this assignment.
    <br> <br>Although I assumed the landscape would be the more difficult of the two, I was wrong. The self
    portrait was tedious, with each shape having to be perfectly sized and place to make the portrait look
    somewhat believable to the human eye. I kept most of the shapes lineless, only using lines around the eyes and 
    the bottom of the opened mouth. </p>
    
      <p></p>
 <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Reflection</h4>  
      <p>Upon reflection, I'm not thrilled with p5.js. I'm sure many people would hav great fun
    creating clever projects in the coding software, but I found it overly tedious for a mediocure product. 
    But, this mostly has to do with the fact that I am a fine artist, not a coder. The portrait looks...maybe like me, 
    but who is to argue with the accuracy of a couple of ovals and well placed triangles? Overall, the results are cute, 
    but not something I'm itching to mess with again.</p>
