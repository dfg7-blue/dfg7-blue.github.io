<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Project Notes</h2>
      <p>For this project, we were tasked with taking photo's of odd still lives
    to then import into Adobe Photoshop, and edit them in a similar style to 
    Lucas Blalock's work. In following his work method, I used a combination of
   the eraser tool, layer masking, the clone stamp tool, and some selection and 
 drawing tools to recreate the surreal and unnatural photoshopped still lives
    that Blalock makes. The title of this project is 'Bad Photoshop' because 
    the mistakes are made clear and visable, adding to the work by leaving parts 
    of the process in the final work. It's not clean, nor is it meant to be.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Process Documentation</h3>
      <img src="IMG_2270.jpeg" alt="posable figure in front of yellow sketchbook" 
           style="width:500px"> 
      <p>This is one of the the source images that I took to use for the Bad 
        Photoshop project. I thought that the bright yellow would make for a good
    source of manipulation in Photoshop. Since I planned on using quite a few of the 
    tools in the program, I wanted to keep my sources simple, as to not overwhelm 
    myself or the viewer. <br> What I ended up doing was focusing on the arms, 
    using the clone stamp and selection tools to create several arms on each side, 
    and then cleaning up the connection areas with the eraser tool. I had the most fun with 
    this image, although I'm not all that happy with the outcome. </p>
    
 <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Reflection</h4>  
      <p>To be honest, I did not enjoy this project. I am someone who agonizes 
    over balanced and clean work, so even though I had fun with the arms in the image
    it's clear I didn't care much for the final product. The yellow, as I figured,
    was fun to mess around with, though I wish the bottom stripes were perfect
  instead of hand drawn. I'm not a fan of Lucas Blalock's
    work, or most of the odd photoshopped still lives that were used as examples. 
    It's safe to say this style of work is not for me, but that's fine. 
    If anything, it was at least a good exersize to introduce me to the several tools
    available to me in Photoshop.</p>
