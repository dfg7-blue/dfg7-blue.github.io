<h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Project Notes</h2>
      <p>For this project, we were tasked with creating two perfect layer 
        masks in Adobe Photoshop, following the style of the artist John 
        Baldessari. Our two images were to be black-and-white photos from 
        the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s. Then, we were asked to select an object or
    person in the photo to mask with a solid color, while leaving the rest of the 
    black-and-white background intact. This was done with a mask layer, the selection 
    and paint brush tool, as well as the paint bucket fill tool. </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Process Documentation</h3>

      <p>This is one of the two images I found to use for his project, and I liked the results
    of this image better than the second one. I chose the middle women in the lighter colored
        outfit for my masked colored object. I made a solid color layer of bright pink,
        which I thought would contrast nicely against the black-and-white image. I then added 
        a layer mask to the solid pink layer, and then with the selection tool,
        I selected the woman to then mask. I had a bit of difficulty at the start
        figuring out which layer I had to mask and in what order, but I eventually 
        figured it out. 
</p>
     
 <h4 style="font-size: 25px;">Reflection</h4>  
      <p>As I stated, the final image was my favorite of the two I created, 
    due to the color choice and the accidental details of the work. I like how the 
    other woman is interacting with the solid colored figure, and that her shoes aren't 
    masked. For me, this begs the question of if she were to drop down and 
    slip on the shoes, would the shoes turn pink or will she be pink figure with real 
    3D shoes. In the end, this project allowed me to mess with masking, while keeping 
    the creation process simple enough that I wasn't overwhelmed. </p>
