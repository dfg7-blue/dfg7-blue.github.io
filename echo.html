        <h1 style="color: yellowgreen;"> Memory</h1>
        <p style="color: yellowgreen;"> If we were to lose all of our 
            memories, do we then <b>cease to exist?</b> Are we then reborn? 
            What makes us, us? Then, if after a while our memories return 
            to us, does that new person that was born then cease to exist 
            as the original is now back? Or are we the same now, a combination 
            of two experiences?</p>

        <h2 style="color: yellowgreen;">Fading</h2>
        <p style="color: yellowgreen;"> I think, continuing off of memory, 
            I'd prefer to lose my body than my mind, if I had to choose. Although 
            in either case I would prefer to just die, I'd much rather retain myself 
            than be in top shape. We may become 'different' people due to extreme circumstances, 
            but I think losing all of your memories and having your personality 
            altered due to a disease is much more drastic.</p>
